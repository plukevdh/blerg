There are some problems in software engineering that take up a non-trivial amount of brain-time to figure out. It's those problems that your brain comes back to even when you're not thinking about them. It's the problems that will not let you rest, even after you've solved it. This seems to be the curse of "Make it work, make it right, make it fast." from the Unix Way.

As it turns out, right and fast are two very abstract and subjective parameters.

For me, performance (make it fast) is usually the one that makes my brain twitch. There's a sort of paralysis in my brain around how I collect, iterate over, combine, use data. It's never efficient enough, even if it is "good enough for normal use." I can't stop thinking about how to make that loop just a bit more efficient or how I can cache those results in a more space- or query-efficient way.



They say there are only two really hard things in software: Naming things, and cache invalidation.
