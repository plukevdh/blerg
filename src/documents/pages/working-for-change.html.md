Hi. My name is Luke and I'm an engineer who works for an ad/experience agency called BFG. Sound like a paradox? Well let's get some background. I got a degree in Computer Science, interned for some very large hardware manufacturers, did some time developing data visualizing data for the USAF, went to work for a small telco for a few years, and spent some time in the startup world. All those gigs were very focused on output, building things for the company's customer(s).

But now, I do none of that. What's even more entertaining is that I'm doing it (or rather not doing it) while working for a company that is even **more** about product output than any of the previous jobs I've worked at. The difference is that I got hired to work on the company. I'm no longer focused on the external outputs, but the internal ones. And I'm having the time of my life doing it.

Over the years as I've worked on products of various kinds and capabilities, the focus has generally been the product and the customer, which when you're building a product to sell, that's sort of important. In most of these experiences, though, I've found a great lacking in care for self, the enrichment of people who are building, the interest in making _how_ we work easier, not just in making what we're working on easier for our customers. And honestly, there are few companies who have "how do we do work together" figured out *less* than BFG. And that's okay!

Being an engineer means I like problems. The harder and more interesting the better. And what better problem to solve than people problems. These types of problems, ones with a root in cultures and societal constructs, are often termed "wicked" problems [\[1\]][1]. These problems are ones without exact solutions, or perhaps any solution at all.

This can be a scary place to operate. This is why I gravitated towards software. Computers are generally a very exact thing. You tell them what to do, they do it without question or emotion. People pull in reasoning, emotion, and personal experience into the mix and it gets really messy. But in the people space, we have an opportunity to create real change, to affect people's behavior, to help people be more satisfied with and productive at what they do.

And really, this is where it matters. Hopefully the customers or clients who use the things you create are enriched and find enjoyment in your products, but if you can change the environment you work in to be a better place, you create a culture eager and able to build the incredible. Everybody wins: The company, the client, and in the agency case, the client's clients.

Right now in my career, I'd rather work for a company who doesn't have it all right, which is still in the weeds of "how do we actually work here" than one that does. Building a company is way cooler than building a product. No matter what you do, what your title or role is or what your company does, be an engineer of happiness. The people are always more important than the product.
