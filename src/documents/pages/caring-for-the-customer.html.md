_But who is the customer?_

I had a somewhat revelationary thought today as I continue to think about how agency work is different from just about any other technical industry today. The thought went something like this:

> Agencies have a problem caring for their end-user because their end-user is not their customer. The client is their customer.

It sheds a lot of light on why I believe agency-developed software looks so good yet is rife with performance issues and poorly written code. It's ultimately because we don't care about the people using the software.

When you're developing an application where the user is also the one paying for the production of the application, you _have_ to be concerned about how well it works, how fast it is, and how well it meets the requirements of the users. Otherwise the user will abandon you for someone doing the same thing but better. In an agency, the people putting the money down for the design and development of the software: 

1. Don't typically understand the process of development or requirements of the customer
2. Don't care because they're using the software as a vehicle to get the customer to something else (a product)

This is where an agency is _supposed_ to shine: Understanding both customer and client to deliver something that makes both happy. The problem is, of the two parties making demands on how the product should work, only one holds the power of the Almighty Dollar when making those decisions. And as I said earlier, this voice typically doesn't _actually care_ about the product the agency is delivering. They care about the product they are trying to deliver **through** your product. 

### This is a shame.

As an engineer, I care deeply about the product I am building, to a point where I believe, ethically, I am doing people an injustice by providing poor quality in anything that I do. It's very hard for me to strike a balance between good enough to deliver and good enough for me. 

At the same time, agencies typically have very fast turnaround times with very limited schedules with a propensity towards chaos. While product and project managers are supposed to help alleviate this chaos, it generally still remains the standard *modus operandi* of many agencies. This leads to stopping at "make it work" rather than moving on to the "right" and "fast" steps of "Make it work, make it right, make it fast" of the [Unix philosophy of software][1].

### It's also a false dichotomy.

Ultimately, your client's customers will bias their view of the client or product by the software by which they interact with it first. This means that we, as agents of a client, should work to best represent the client to the end-users. The client is paying us to represent them _to their customers_, not to _themselves_. So ultimately, we should make decisions on how our customers will experience our clients. 

Viewing our role in this way should ultimately cause us to write code that is easier to maintain, that performs better. We should be eager to show off the client to the customer by having a stunning site that also runs exceptionally well and that is designed with the customer's experience in mind. There should be no splitting between trying to attain the client's desires and giving the customer something they'll enjoy using. If we chose one or the other independently, ultimately **both** parties will be unsatisfied.
