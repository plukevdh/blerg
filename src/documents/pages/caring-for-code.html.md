My previous job was with a startup named SalesCrunch. We were building online meeting and presentation software for sales teams, trying to "disrupt" the WebEx/GoToMeeting space. It ultimately shutdown and sold out to [ClearSlide](https://www.clearslide.com/). It ultimately was a good example of a startup's product team losing vision for the original and unique goal it set out to accomplish. On the development side, however, the engineers were unique in that they cared about the quality of the code, the architecture, design and so forth. So in stark contrast, my current job is a company filled with developers either too pressed for time or too innundated with technical debt of years past to make quality decisions about doing things right.
